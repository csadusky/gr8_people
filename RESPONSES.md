1. Please respond to the questions below in reference to Task 1.
   1. In a few sentences, please describe how you completed this task.
      > First I wanted to get a basic understanding of how the app was working. I started in the app.js to see how state was handled, css, and how props were passed to components. One of the first things I wasnt sure of was usestate, so I looked that up.  I also looked up some info on JSS and clsx since I was unfamilar with them. After getting a basic understanding, I took a look at the ApprovalList.js. From there I was able to understand how I needed to set everything up in ApprovalView.js. Then I separated my task into chucks, first using clsx to get the correct color on the top banner, then expanding on that process to get the correct styles for the list of approvers for each approval (also using map like in approvalList to iterate over the approvers), next formatting and validating the time requested and submitted, and finally apply styling and testing.
   2. About how long did this task take you to complete? Was this longer or shorter than you initially expected?
      > This took a few hours, mainly because of all the research I was doing. It took about as long as I expected. I knew once I had the basic understanding down, I would be able to complete the actual task pretty quickly.
   3. Given more time, is there anything you would done differently?
      > One thing I would have like to spend more time on was playing around with the nested styles and themes. Then I would be able to remove some lines of code by adding the accepted/rejected styling to the top level div and combining badgeClassName and badgeIconName classes.
2. Please respond to the questions below in reference to Task 2.
   1. In a few sentences, please describe how you completed this task.
      > I used the usestate hook that was already set up in the app.js. I changed the state  for selectedIndex with the function setSelectedIndex. I just needed to pass setSelectedIndex to ApprovalList as a prop and once that is done, use the onclick handler to call setSelectedIndex and update selectedIndex
   2. About how long did this task take you to complete? Was this longer or shorter than you initially expected?
      > This was pretty quick to do.  It took less than half an hour.  I already had an idea how to do it from doing my initial research. It took around the time I expected it to.
   3. Given more time, is there anything you would done differently?
      > I dont think so. Still was a pretty simple task.
